## Overview

During our full-stack unit at General Assembly (Jan - Apr 2021), we created an app that reflected our newly acquired skills in the MERN stack. To figure out what we wanted to do for this group project, we brainstormed ideas by discussing our interests. We all found a common need for a better way to track the care of our plants. We came up with the name Plant Buddi and started listing all of the things we might want to keep track of when caring for plants. Once we defined the features we wanted in MVP, we began development. 



## About Plant Buddi

Plant Buddi is a tool to help you keep track of all of your plant friends. Search our database to find a plant friend to add to your plants list. You can edit each plant to include information such as nickname, last watered date, and lighting needs. If you no longer need to keep track of a buddi, you can remove them from your list. Return to Plant Buddi whenever you need to reference something about your buddis to make sure they get the care that they need to be happy and healthy.
